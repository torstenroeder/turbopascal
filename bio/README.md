# BIO

## What is Bio?

A collection of implementations of John Horton Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) from the 1970s. It is more a simulation than a game. I implemented this around 1995 after I had read about Conway's Game in a book or a magazine.

## Variants

### BIO

A very simple implementation on a 40x40 board. Keyboard controls.

### BIO2

A very simple implementation on a 40x40 board. Mouse controls.
Needs to be fixed. Something about the mouse does not work anymore.

### BIO3

A variant with another cell type (red versus green). Mouse controls.
Needs to be fixed. Something about the mouse does not work anymore.

### BIO5

This is more like an actual game. You get points for generating life. You have a limited number of cells you can put on the board, and time is also limited. Highscores are recorded. My classmate Thomas beat all my records by scoring nearly 4,000,000 points (no idea how). Keyboard controls.

## How to run the simulation

Executable files are available here: [bio.zip](http://turbo.elitepiraten.de/bio.zip)

You will need an emulator like [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com) to start the game.
