*** Thron - The Third ***
-------------------------

Following files must be contained in one directory to make Thron run:

1. Thron3us.exe (for us keyboard)
   or Thron3gr.exe (german keyboard layout)
2. egavga.bgi (graphic device)
3. sans.chr (font)

You should start Thron from its folder so that Thron can create the files "Players.dat" and "Setup.dat" in it, in case they aren't accessible yet. Those files will be needed to save configuration and player data.

Thron was written in Turbo Pascal 7.0 and compiled on a K6-233.

Please send any suggestions and comments (welcome) and bug reports (less welcome) to "Torsten_Roeder@public.uni-hamburg.de".

The princpile of the game should be known, so I don't need to explain it here.
