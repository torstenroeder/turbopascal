# turbopascal

This is a vintage collection of some early programming work in Turbo Pascal from the 1990s.

## How to start

You will need an emulator like [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com) to start the programs.

Alternatively, you can compile the source code yourself in an environment like [TPWDB](https://turbopascal-wdb.sourceforge.io).

For compiling, you possibly need to adjust the path in `initgraph(gd,gm,'..\BGI')` to whereever your Turbo Pascal BGI path is.

## Projects

**[Attacks](../../tree/main/attacks)**
– A PvE implementation of »Battleships«.

**[Bio](../../tree/main/bio)**
– Four implementations of Conway's »Game of Life«.

**[Evolute](../../tree/main/evolute)**
– A predator-prey simulation with rabbits, wolves, and humans, in two variants.

**[Land](../../tree/main/land)**
– A configurable generator for geographic maps.

**[Mandel](../../tree/main/mandel)**
– Four visualization programs of Mandelbrot and Julia set.

**[Thron](../../tree/main/thron)**
– A game for up to six human or computer players, based on »Tron«.

**[Tiles](../../tree/main/tiles)**
– A tile board game for one player. Can you arrange all tiles on the board? ASCII visuals.

**[Units](../../tree/main/units)**
