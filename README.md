# turbopascal

This is a vintage collection of some early programming work in Turbo Pascal from the 1990s.

## How to start

You will need an emulator like [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com) to start the programs.

Alternatively, you can compile the source code yourself in an environment like [TPWDB](https://turbopascal-wdb.sourceforge.io).

## Projects

– Four implementations of Conway's »Game of Life«.

**[Evolute](../../tree/main/evolute)**
– A predator-prey simulation with rabbits, wolves, and humans, in two variants.

**[Land](../../tree/main/land)**
– A configurable generator for geographic maps.

**[Mandel](../../tree/main/mandel)**
– Four visualization programs of Mandelbrot and Julia set.

**[Thron](../../tree/main/thron)**
